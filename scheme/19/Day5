** Setup

  Intcode programs are comma separated lists of ints. To start, we
  load some code and read the input.
  
#+begin_src scheme :session :exports code
(load "~/code/advent/load.ss")
(advent-year 19)
(advent-day 5)

(define intcode
  (parse-advent comma-separated))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

** Operating

   Today, we give the machine an input value, run it to completion,
   and read its output signal.

#+begin_src scheme :session :exports code
(define (run-day5 intcode seed)
  (let ((M (machine intcode 0)))
    (M 'in seed)
    (run-until-halt M)
    (M 'out)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #<void>

  Of course, the ~code/intcode.ss~ file is setup so that there's not
  really anything to do here.

** Results
  
#+begin_src scheme :session :exports results :results value
(cons (run-day5 intcode 1) (run-day5 intcode 5))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (7265618 . 7731427)
